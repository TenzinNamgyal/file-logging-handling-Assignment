    "Ans 15:- Python’s garbage collection system works by automatically freeing memory of objects that are no longer in use using reference counting and generational garbage collection to handle circular references and improve memory efficiency.  \n",
    "#### 1. Reference Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each object in Python keeps a count of references pointing to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When the reference count drops to zero, the object is no longer accessible and is immediately deallocated.  \n",
    "#### 2. Handling Circular References\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sometimes objects reference each other, forming cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reference counting alone cannot free these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python’s garbage collector detects and removes circular references.  \n",
    "#### 3. Generational Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python uses generational GC: objects are grouped by age (young, middle-aged, old)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Younger objects are collected more frequently because they tend to become unreachable faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Older objects are checked less often to save time.  \n",
    "#### 4. Garbage Collection Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "    gc module allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inspect objects\n",
    "\n",
    "    Enable/disable GC\n",

    "\n",
    "    Open files consume system memory and file descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "    Not closing files can lead to resource leaks, especially in programs that open many files\n",

    "#### 2. Ensures Data Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data may be buffered in memory before writing to disk\n",
    "\n",
    "    Closing the file ensures that all data is properly written\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Prevents File Corruption\n",
    "\n",
    "    Leaving files open may corrupt the file if the program crashes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Avoids Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "    Most operating systems have a limit on the number of open files\n",
    "\n",
    "    Closing files prevents reaching this limit\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Best Practice\n",

    "    Always close files using:\n",

    "    file.close()\n",

    "#### 3. High Memory Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python stores objects as full objects in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, lists, dictionaries, and strings can use more memory than equivalent low-level structures in C\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Garbage Collection Overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "    Garbage collection runs periodically\n",
    "\n",
    "    Can cause performance overhead, especially in programs with many objects\n",

    "    Handling large datasets (big lists, arrays) may consume significant memory\n",

    "    Need efficient data structures or external storage\n",
